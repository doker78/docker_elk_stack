Docker and webapp with ELK





It is based on the following componnents:

Elasticsearch, search engine which provide full text search & analytics
Logstash, an ETL for retrieving data from heterogeneous sources, transforming them and sending them to Elasticsearch
Kibana, which provide an UI for exploring data, and create interactive dashboards
Redis, an upstream broker which will serve as buffer in case of latency of the system, while avoiding excessive congestion in case of a peak
Curator, a tool to manage our index
Beats, client-side agent to send the logs/metrics to our stack

List of containers version for each stack component

Elasticsearch (6.3.2)
Logstash (6.3.2),
Kibana (6.3.2),
Redis (latest),
Curator (latest)


Build with docker-compose

build the images
  docker-compose build

 Run with docker-compose

run stack added -d for daemon mode
  docker-compose up -d
inspect the logs
  docker-compose logs -f

 Access kibana for view status after successfully set up 

  http://KIBANA_HOST:5061


 Build and Run the webapp and let to Kibana monitoring 

  docker build ./webapp -t dockerelkstack_webapp
  docker run --network dockerelkstack_logging --link redis:redis -p 80:80 -d --name webapp dockerelkstack_webapp

  Itâ€™s possible to automatically restart crashed containers by specifying a restart policy when initiating the container
  --restart always

 docker run --network dockerelkstack_logging --restart always --link redis:redis -p 80:80 -d --name webapp dockerelkstack_webapp

Joli is a free admin template/Dashboard/Web App based on Angular JS
 Then navigate on the site [AdminUI](http://localhost) port 80 for Access to Joli Admin UI


 Index management with Curator after ELK is UP

  docker run --network dockerelkstuck_logging --link elastic:elasticsearch -v "./curator/config":/config --rm bobrik/curator:latest --config /config/config.yml /config/actions.yml

 After few minutes browsing, returning to Kibana
 An index is now available  


 After creating index, we can now exploring our web app logs (Discover tab)  
 Create visualizations (Visualize tab) and dashboards (Dashboard tab)
